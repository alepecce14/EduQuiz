# Gemini API by dsdanielpark
The project was originally based on the [Bard-API](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API) package by [dsdanielpark](https://github.com/dsdanielpark). However, when Google Bard was replaced by [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/?hl=it), the code was rewritten to fit the newest [Gemini-API](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Gemini-API) by the same creator of Bard-API.
