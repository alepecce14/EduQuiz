# EduQuiz
Adapted AI API that creates quizzes based on the notes you give as prompt.

# Gemini API by dsdanielpark
The project was originally based on the [Bard-API](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API) package by [dsdanielpark](https://github.com/dsdanielpark). However, when Google Bard was replaced by [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/?hl=it), the code was rewritten to fit the newest [Gemini-API](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Gemini-API) by the same creator of Bard-API. 

# Website
You can try EduQuiz [here](https://eduquiz.pythonanywhere.com/)
You can either prompt a general topic (eg. The history of the computer) or, if you want better result, some notes you took in class or from a textbook.
Functionality is not guaranteed as, at the moment, cookie stability isn't the best.
